# MySpotifyPlayer

My first attempt to use Spotify API

My idea is to be able, first, to use Spotify to search for songs. Then, add a music player to it (somehow). I don't know how I'm going to do it, yet...

Later, I'd like to add YouTube support, so whenever I search for an artist/song/ or whatever, I can play from both sources.

Just for fun, that's it.
